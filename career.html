        <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

        <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

        <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
          <li>175g of tahini</li>
          <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
          <li>Half a red pepper</li>
          <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
          <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
          <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
          <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
          <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
          <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
            <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

        <h3>Storage</h3>

        <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

        <blockquote>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</blockquote>
